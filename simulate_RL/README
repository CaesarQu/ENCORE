here we simulate an RL agent for offloading

code uses A2C algorithm in tensorflow and python3

1.      FaceNet_four_action_simulator/

        - Simulation env for facenet video experiments
        - named Four action since action space has 4 actions:
            - use past robot
            - curr robot
            - past cloud
            - curr cloud

        - has the sim environment, benchmark controller utils, and script to compare them all on test traces
